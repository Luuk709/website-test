                <p>In October 2021, the band, without any prior notice, released their EP A Tear In The Fabric Of Life. The concept record documents the "story of someone wading through extreme grief". An animated short film, which accompanies the entire span of the EP, was released at the same time. It was directed by Swedish director Magnus Jonsson. The release, as well as the short film, gained mostly positive reviews. Its song "God Knows" was elected by Loudwire as the 30th best metal song of 2021.</p>
